# Coding Challenge

## Programming

Use `k401.dta` to replicate the QMLE models specified in `Papke and Wooldridge 1996`, section 4, equations `22` and `23`. Use them to reproduce the results in `Table III`.

## Analysis

Assume: 
- `total employees = 20,000` 
- On average, employees contribute 21% of salary
- Employer contributes 7% of salary.
- The 401k is not the sole pension plan for the employer.
- Age of account = 12 years.
- Donâ€™t worry about IRS limits or other outside factors.

1. How do you think predictions from (22) and (23) will match with the employer's participation rate?

2. Which model seems more reasonable and why?

## Deliverables

.zip archive the following:
1. The code files.
2. Replicate Table III output (.pdf, .docx, .html).
3. 2-3 paragraphs summarizing your analysis aimed at a non-technical policy maker audience (.pdf, .docx, .html).

## Time

=< 8 hours. If you had more time, what would you do?
